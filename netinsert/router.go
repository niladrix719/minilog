// Reference: streamRowsTracker in app/vlstorage/netinsert/netinsert.go.

// RoutingPolicy decides which storage node a row is sent to.
//
// You already wrote a router once: Storage.shardForStreamID in
// minilog/storage.go, choosing among in-process shards. This is the same
// function one level up, and the reason it deserves a whole stage here and
// three lines there is that the cost of a bad choice is different. A skewed
// in-process shard costs you a lock; a skewed storage node costs you a machine.

	// RoutingHybrid is the default and is what VictoriaLogs does: a stream's
	// first StickyRowsPerStream rows go to one node chosen by its hash, and
	// everything after that is sprayed at random.
	//
	// The argument, which is worth reconstructing before you read theirs: a
	// stream with forty rows is a rounding error, so keeping it whole costs
	// nothing and makes a stream-filtered query cheap. A stream with forty
	// million rows is the query you actually care about, and you want every
	// node grinding on it at once. The threshold is where one turns into the
	// other.

	// RoutingSticky sends every row of a stream to the same node, forever.
	//
	// Perfect locality, and it is a trap. Real log streams are Zipfian: a
	// handful of chatty services produce most of the volume. Sticky routing
	// puts each of those on exactly one node. Stage 7 measures how bad that
	// gets, and the number is larger than most people guess.
	RoutingSticky

	// RoutingSpray picks a node uniformly at random per row.
	//
	// Perfect balance, no locality. Every stream is smeared across every node,
	// so a single-stream query is a full fan-out and the merge has real work
	// to do. Implement it even though nobody would ship it: it is the control
	// in the experiment, and it is also the routing that will find the merge
	// bugs stage 8 cares about, because it guarantees streams are split.
	//
	// Random, not round-robin. Round-robin correlates node assignment with
	// arrival order, so if anything upstream batches by stream -- and
	// something always does -- you get a systematically skewed distribution
	// that looks perfectly balanced in a synthetic test.
