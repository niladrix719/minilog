	// order, not an arbitrary Limit of them. That definition is what makes
	// the limit pushable to storage nodes in stage 10: each node's local
	// first-Limit rows are guaranteed to contain that node's contribution to
	// the global first-Limit, so merging N truncated streams and truncating
	// again gives exactly the untruncated answer.

	// pushdown that returns the wrong rows is silent.
